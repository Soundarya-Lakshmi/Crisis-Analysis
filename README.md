QuickBite, an online food delivery startup, faced a major crisis in June 2025 due to a viral food-safety incident and a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season. 
This led to sharp drops in orders, revenue, ratings, and customer trust. In this project, I analyzed QuickBite’s pre-crisis (Jan–May 2025) and crisis (Jun–Sep 2025) performance using Power BI and SQL. 
I evaluated customer behavior shifts, restaurant churn risk, delivery delays, category-wise order patterns, and top 5% high-value customer impact. 
The dashboard highlights key insights and provides data-driven recommendations to support QuickBite’s recovery strategy.
